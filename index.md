## Welcome!

I'm currently an undergraduate at the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying CS, Economics, and Math. Please keep scrolling to learn more about my experience!

## Experience
### Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity
Since May 2020, I have been a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon's Institute of Software Engineering under the [Usable Privacy Project](https://usableprivacy.org/) led by [Dr. Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/). I entered the lab under CMU's REUSE program (Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering), funding by the National Science Foundation. 
My summer research surrounds retrieving and analyzing privacy policy annotations that will be used to train classifiers this fall. For more details on specific summer projects, please see my [research poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12tBh-98MjQ0X2deKFk2S-3HEpf9VtWpe/view?usp=sharing).
I am continuing my work with Dr. Norman Sadeh this fall by researching and developing a method that will help detect and extract information from tables found in privacy policies. Given the amount of useful information stored in privacy policy tables, this work will help with NLP tasks such as named-entity recognition on privacy policy text.
### Data Science and Community Engagement Manager at DSC-WAV
During Fall 2020, I worked with DSC-WAV (Data Science-Wrangle, Analyze, Visualize), an NSF funded program in which undergraduates work in small teams as data scientists serving local, community-based non-profits. My team worked with HampshireHOPE, an organization that helps individuals suffering from an opioid addiction find guidance and treatment. Through our project, we helped create multiple heat maps that showed how long it takes to get to different types of treatment centers from hundreds of points across Hampshire and Hampden County in Massachusetts through public transportation. Our project will help HampshireHOPE identify places where more treatment centers will be needed and where transportation services could expand according to healthcare needs. 
As a data scientist, I helped implement algorithms that call Google APIs such as the Google Maps Distance Matrix and the Google Maps JS API to help calculate distances, time, and map our findings. As a community engagement manager, I helped run stand-up and sprint planning meetings. I also helped coordinate with HampshireHOPE to understand their needs to create an appropriate project proposal and continuously check-in about our progress as a team. Finally, I helped compile a [mid-term report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8bDYCPaKNY33ErHW9stHjf11DnuERrufc4Fo5AcALQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QRZxkog-LC_X1_U3mIfjH3SXfgKzC44sY1iKccIY9QA/edit?usp=sharing) to document our work.
### Front-End Development Intern
From Summer 2019 to May 2020, I was a part of the development team of a small company that helps implement technologies to help corporations report oil/chemical spills and/or cyber-attacks. I helped implement the front-end of user sign-up forms and created a component that helps automatically fill out letters and forms, saving workers hours of tedious tasks. Later, I also helped implement a searchable table which helped display information from the company's database. [Github](https://github.com/19mangatj/Spill-Center-Internship-2019)
### Software Engineer at BUILD UMass
BUILD UMass helps local companies in the Amherst area with their tech need whether it's through building apps or designing databases through student volunteers. During Spring 2020, I worked on an internal project to help create a web auth system for our organization's web application. 
During fall and winter, I am working D3.js and Angular to help create components for OpenThink, a student-run start up.
## Hackathon Projects
### OpenWhen @ Boston Hacks 2019
OpenWhen allows users to send notes to their friends that they can "open when..." they feel sad, happy, etc.

### Reflec @ HackHer413 2020
Reflec allows people to send live feedback to a speaker or lecturer through a given set up buttons. The speaker then gets a transpript of their talk with indications for where listeners might have been confused or when they liked a point the speaker brought up to allow them to improve their talk for the next time.
