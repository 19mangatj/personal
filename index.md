## Experience
### Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity
Since May 2020, I have been a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon's Institute of Software Engineering under the [Usable Privacy Project](https://usableprivacy.org/) led by [Dr. Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/). I entered the lab under CMU's REUSE program (Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering), funding by the National Science Foundation. 
My summer research surrounds retrieving and analyzing privacy policy annotations that will be used to train classifiers this fall. For more details on specific summer projects, please see my [research poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12tBh-98MjQ0X2deKFk2S-3HEpf9VtWpe/view?usp=sharing).
I am continuing my work with Dr. Norman Sadeh this fall by researching and developing a method that will help detect and extract information from tables found in privacy policies. Given the amount of useful information stored in privacy policy tables, this work will help with NLP tasks such as named-entity recognition on privacy policy text.
### Data Science and Community Engagement Manager at DSC-WAV
This fall, I will be working with a small group of undergraduates in another NSF funded program in which we will work on providing data science services to community-based nonprofits in the Amherst area. As the Community Engagement Manager, I will be in charge of leading standup meetings, sprint planning, and coordinating between our development team and our client. As a data scientist, I will also be a part of the development team to help implement our product. More information to come once the program starts!
### Front-End Development Intern
From Summer 2019 to May 2020, I was a part of the development team of a small company that helps implement technologies to help corporations report oil/chemical spills and/or cyber-attacks. I helped implement the front-end of user sign-up forms and created a component that helps automatically fill out letters and forms, saving workers hours of tedious tasks. Later, I also helped implement a searchable table which helped display information from the company's database. [Github](https://github.com/19mangatj/Spill-Center-Internship-2019)
### Software Engineer at BUILD UMass
BUILD UMass helps local companies in the Amherst area with their tech need whether it's through building apps or designing databases through student volunteers. Last spring, I worked on an internal project to help create a web auth system for our organization's web application.
